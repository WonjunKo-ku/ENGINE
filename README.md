# ENGINE
A deep learning framework for imaging genetics.

We used Tensorflow 2.0 for the implementation.
We used publicly-available  ADNI dataset, and overall preprocessing procedures are described in our paper.

utils.py includes utility functions, engine.py is the proposed framework, and finally, engine_experiment.py is used for the experiments.
